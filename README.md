# THE FUTURE IS ALMOST HERE!

This moment in human history will be remembered as the birth of the EASIEST programming language known to mankind (and womankind, peoplekind). 

# BEHOLD!

I present you the üçã aka the Lemon Language!
Why? I hear you ask,.. well..

**Because:** 
- it will be easy-peasy-lemon-squeezy
- when life gives you lemons you make a Lemon Language
- why not?
- for fun üòÅ

## Extension
`.ll` - stands for lemon language, should be cool. 

## Ecosystem
none whatsoever

## FAQ 
| Question | Answer |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Does it support ... | No bro, it doesn't. Mainly because it doesn't exist yet, but this is precisely why it is so powerful: it could potentially support whatever you were going to ask me about. |
| What's next? | We shall take one step at a time, *A gigalitre of lemonade starts with the first lemon, as the old Chinese proverb doesn't say.* I guess I'll start playing with syntax and parse it with combinator parser in Elixir. We'll see...|

## TODO
- what should Lemon compile to? Chances to implement increase as we go down the list.
  - assembly (yeah sure)
  - C (a bit more realistic)
  - Core Erlang 
  - Elixir. A toy language |> Elixir compiler |> erlc |> fat binary .beam files?
